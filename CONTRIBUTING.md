# Contribution guidelines

This project uses simplified version of the Github Flow system. Releases are not included, and `dev` branch is not separated from `master` branch. All features, bug fixes and updates are done in separate branches and then merged through PRs.

## Instuction on feature development

1. Create a new branch with suitable name in local repo
2. Push it to the origin
3. Write your code
4. Ensure the quality of the code: lint, test, if necessary, run it
5. Commit all changes separately, try to do perfect commits - this would help a lot during merging
6. Open PR, mentioning all issues and project tasks.

## Instruction on bug fixing

1. Create local branch
2. Fix the bug
3. Test and lint the code
4. Commit the fix
5. Push changes and open PR, describing fix and mentioning the issue from GH (this is not optional)
